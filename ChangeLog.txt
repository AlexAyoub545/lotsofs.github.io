Vanilla:
* No changes besides some behind the scenes stuff

Vanilla_AlternativeNumbering:
* Pages are numbered in a more future proof way:
-- The introductionory pages are still numbered as before, but without the 'of 23' (eg. "Page 2")
-- Solvable module pages have their numbering prefixed with "1.", starting countdown at "Page 1.1" for the title page.
-- Needy module pages have their numbering prefixed with "2.", starting countdown at "Page 2.1" for the title page.
-- Appendices will have roman numeral page numbering, eg. "Page III".

Modded Manuals:
* By default, besides distinction between solvable, needy & appendix, page ordering will be determined by module release date, similar to how the vanilla manual is not sorted alphabetically either.  

Road To Centurion 1:
* Changed the introduction pages to account for mods
-- Bombs can have more than 11 modules
-- Bombs can have more than 2 strikes before blowing
-- Not every module can be solved in any order
-- There are more appendices than just A, B and C. Some manuals may not refer to A, B, C but still use it.
* Almost every module:
-- changed the ink blot splatter patterns to not be repetitive in context of the entire manual, and added them where they were missing
-- some BTS changes, such as html tags not being closed, and making stuff work in context of the entire manual
-- page numbering, which may not be accurate, due to the non-chronological order I am processing these
* Colour Flash
* Turn The Key
* Turn The Keys: Decreased font sizes because the manual didn't actually fit on one page.
* 3D Maze
* Skewed Slots: Appendix placed in appendices
* Follow The Leader
* Blind Alley 
* Hexamaze
* Battleship: Changed some margins as the manual didn't fit on a page
