	<b>What are these manuals?</b>
Some attempt at merging modded manuals into the vanilla manuals that isn't the game's automatically generated PDF (as I've heard complaints that large PDFs are slow, and most of the mod's provided PDFs are outdated in some way). 
I wanted a manual with everything in one place that I could just link to people and it'd have everything they'd need, and nothing more. The Timwi repo is great, but it can give a bit of a sensory overload if you're new. 

This will also aim to alter some appendices, which are all over the place. Appendices often appear multiple times with repeat information across different mods. 
Inversely, some appendices shouldn't be appendices in the first place, because they provide vital information for one module and one module only, and so these get moved to section 1. 
Some other goals are removing fourth wall breaking things, making manuals more printer friendly, and removing excess information refering to non-included mods.
Lastly, this manual is in English. Translated modules will have their manuals rewritten with an English speaking target audience in mind, not the language in question. This probably means lots and lots of translation tables. I decided to not put these in the appendices, as in-game the modules behave as their own separate entity in their own right, and the manual will reflect that. Also, this saves printer ink.
Special thanks to Timwi and crew for providing these manuals in the first place. 
Please report any differences with the original manuals not listed below.

<b>Extensive change and inclusion log:</b>
All manuals:
* Pages are numbered in a more future proof way:
-- The introductionory pages are still numbered as before, but without the 'of 23' (eg. "Page 2")
-- Solvable module pages have their numbering prefixed with "1.", starting at "Page 1.1" for the title page.
-- Needy module pages have their numbering prefixed with "2.", starting at "Page 2.1" for the title page.
-- Appendices will have roman numeral page numbering, eg. "Page III".
* By default, besides distinction between solvable, needy & appendix, page ordering will be determined by module release date, similar to how the vanilla manual is not sorted alphabetically either.  
* Changed the introduction pages to account for mods
-- Bombs can have more than 11 modules
-- Bombs can have more than 2 strikes before blowing
-- Not every module can be solved in any order
-- There are more appendices than just A, B and C. Some manuals may not refer to A, B, C but still use them.
* Almost every module:
-- changed the ink blot splatter patterns to not be repetitive in context of the entire manual, and added them where they were missing
-- some BTS changes, such as html tags not being closed, and making stuff work in context of the entire manual
-- page numbering added, changed, to fit with the entire manual.

Road To Centurion - section 01:
* Colour Flash
* Turn The Key
* Turn The Keys: Decreased font sizes because the manual didn't actually fit on one page. Removed mentions of modules not actually in this pack.
* 3D Maze
* Skewed Slots: Appendix placed in appendices, and added a mention about negative numbers not being prime.
* Follow The Leader
* Blind Alley 
* Hexamaze
* Battleship: Changed some margins as the manual didn't fit on a page

Road To Centurion - section 02:
* Anagrams
* Word Scramble
* Square Button: Got rid of the red line and gave it the ink blots instead
* Simon States: Last table didn't fit on the page. Lowered table margins.
* Round Keypad
* Listening
* Morsematics: Reference tables moved to appendices, and made to appear like an appendix. Referenced the appendix on the module's main page, had to decrease margins to make it fit. Rid the red line.
* Forget Me Not: Margins to make the page fit, rid the red line.
* Plumbing: Rid the red line
* Safety Safe: Font size of big table to 98% because it just barely didn't fit
* Silly Slots
* Souvenir: Moved the big table to the end of appendices for ease of updating, and removed modules not present in this pack. Changed configuration note to present perfect, as the defuser/expert don't have any control over this, only the out-of-game-world game player.

Road To Centurion - section 03:
* Piano Keys: Moved the piano reference to the appendices, and made it look like an appendix
* Two Bits
* Foreign Exchange Rates: Changed some margins, and decreased the footnotes' font size to fit the page. Adding a table of ISO 4217 codes in the appendices, for printed copy friendliness.
* Adventure game
* Chess: Page 1 didnt fit, margins adjusted
* Murder
* Third Base
* Laundry: Last page shifted up and decreased some margins, as it didn't fit
* Needy Answering Questions
* Needy Rotary Phone

Road To Centurion - section 04:
* Logic: Decreased the margins above and below the appendix notes, as the page barely didn't fit.
* Cryptography: Removed appendices and made them part of the solvable modules section, since these pages are actually required for disarming this module, and this module only. They don't provide useless backstory or optional tips. The top right also said 'Cryptography', indicating that placing these in the appendices was a rushed decision by the creator to begin with. Removing the appendix header also made the excerpt text fit on the page.
* Caesar Cipher
* Bitmaps
* Word Search
* Broken Buttons
* Double-Oh: The entire page's content shifted down a little bit in order to get it work with page numbering
* Neutralization: That appendix looks like it's only going to be ever relevant to neutralization, and is a hard requirement for it. Deappendifying it and moving it to main section 1 content.
* Needy Filibuster: Configuration instructions go in the readme.txt or the workshop description, not in the defusal manual. Due to lack of these instructions in either, it has been moved to the appendices, with a reference. It has also been reworded a little to not break the fourth wall. A mention that the module requires a microphone still exists on the main page.

Road To Centurion - section 05:
* Emoji Math
* Mouse In The Maze: Reduced margins to make the list and the table fit on the page.
* Number Pad
* The Gamepad: Moved the main body up a bit to fit the page. Merged the mathematical concepts appendix with Skewed Slots' maths appendix.
* Monsplode, Fight: Changed the padding of the move types table cells as the big table didn't fit on the page.
* Sea Shells
* Coordinates
* Rubik's Cube: Shrunk some margins to fit the page
* Binary LEDs
* Needy Math
* Needy Tetris

Road To Centurion - section 06:
# Translated Modules:
= Rewritten all manuals to be more condensed and english-speaker oriented. 
= References are made to the original manual for instructions, so these pages can be used for new information only. 
= Included barcode sticker reference.
= Changed the Cyrillic font to something (more) readable, because I'm sorry but the other one was horrible. I don't like the look of this one, but at least it's consistent and easy to read.
= Some tiny changes with compatibility with non latin languages.
= Most non-latin languages had their font size increased where table cells permit.
* Who's On First (Translated): 
- Merged step 1 tables to be 3 languages on 1 page (more didn't fit on the page, but would also make it too difficult). 
- Some of the step 2 tables were able to be made smaller to fit two on one page. It makes it look a little different, but the gameplay experience should be close enough to the original for me to be okay with that. 
- Condensed 42 pages to 21 (Step 1: 21 to 8, Step 2: 21 to 13).
* Simon Screams
* Modules Against Humanity: Lowered margins to fit the page
* Complicated Buttons: Moved the bottom-most table up a little to fit the page
* Symbolic Password
* The Button (Translated): 
- Put a big table with the translations for all four labels 
- Condensed 21 pages to 1.
* Morse Code (Translated): 
- Put lots and lots of reference tables 
- Condensed 21 pages to 5.
* Passwords (Translated):
- 6 tables on one page! :O
- Condensed 21 pages to 4.
* Needy Who's That Monsplode
* Needy Vent Gas (Translated):
- Put a big table with the translations for the two buttons and the two Questions
- Condensed 21 pages to 1.
