            <h2>On the Subject of Colour Flash</h2>
            <p class="flavour-text">
                It’s easy to identify colours. Red, Blue, Green, etc. Turns out it's a bit harder when you display a word colour in a different colour though...
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A Colour Flash module will repeatedly flash a sequence of 8 different words representing colours in different colours.</li>
                <li>The possible colours are Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Magenta and White.</li>
                <li>There is also a Yes button and a No button on the module.</li>
                <li>Only <em>one</em> of the Yes and No buttons need to be pressed to disarm the module, but must be pressed at the correct time according to the rules below.</li>
                <li>The colour of the last word in the sequence determines which set of rules to follow below.</li>
                <li>Follow the rules down from the top-most rule, down to the bottom-most rule for the block that applies to your module.</li>
            </ul>

                         <div>If Green is used as the word at least three times in the sequence, press Yes on the third time Green is used as either the word or the colour of the word in the sequence.</div>
                         <div>Otherwise, if Blue is used as the colour of the word exactly once, press No when the word Magenta is shown.</div>
                         <div>Otherwise, press Yes the last time White is either the word or the colour of the word in the sequence.</div>

                         <div>Otherwise, if the word White is shown in either White or Red colour, press Yes on the second time in the sequence where the colour of the word does not match the word itself.</div>
                         <div>Otherwise, count the number of times Magenta is used as either the word or the colour of the word in the sequence (the word Magenta in Magenta colour only counts as one), and press No on the colour in the total's position (e.g. a total of 4 means the fourth colour in sequence).</div>
