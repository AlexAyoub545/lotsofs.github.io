            <li>A skewed slots module contains 3 numeric displays and a submit button on it.</li>
            <li>Based on the current display on the slots, submit the correct digits based on following sections of rules. Each section is labeled with which slot it applies to.</li>
            <li>After all the rules have been applied, if the number is below 0, add 10. Otherwise if the number is above 9, subtract 10. Repeat this until the number is between 0-9.</li>
            <li>If you submit the incorrect digits, the slots will automatically spin and a strike will be assigned.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> The original digit is the digit before it was modified at all.

                        If the number is a multiple of 3, add 4 to it.

                        Otherwise, if the number is less than 3 and it's an even number, divide it by 2.

                        Otherwise, if there is an RCA or a PS/2 port on the bomb, skip the rest of the rules in this section.

                        Otherwise, take the original digit and add the number of batteries on the bomb.
