        <h1>Defusing Bombs</h1>

        <p>A bomb will explode when its countdown timer reaches 0:00 or when too many strikes have been recorded. The only way to defuse a bomb is to disarm all of its modules before its countdown timer expires.</p>

            <table>
                <tr>

        <h3>Modules</h3>
        <p>Each bomb will include a certain number of modules that must be disarmed. With a few exceptions, each module is discrete and can be disarmed in any order.</p>
        <p>Instructions for disarming modules can be found in Section 1. "Needy" modules present a special case and are described in Section 2. Translation help for translated modules can be found in Section 3.</p>

        <h3>Strikes</h3>
        <div class="timer-diagram"><span>Strike Indicator</span>
            <br><img src="img/module-icons/TimerComponent.svg"></div>
        <p>When the Defuser makes a mistake, the bomb will record a strike which will be displayed on the indicator above the countdown timer. Bombs with a strike indicator will typically explode upon the third strike. The timer will begin to count down faster after a strike has been recorded.</p>
        <p>If no strike indicator is present above the countdown timer, the bomb will explode upon the first strike, leaving no room for error.</p>
        <p>The strike indicator will only display up to two strikes. Any additional strikes will not be displayed, even if the bomb allows more than two strikes.</p>

        <h3>Gathering Information</h3>
        <p>Some disarming instructions will require specific information about the bomb, such as the serial number or other widgets. This type of information can typically be found on the top, bottom, or sides of the bomb casing.</p> 
        <p>Many modules will require information about Indicators, Batteries, or Ports. See Appendix A, B, and C for identification instructions. Manual pages of certain modules requiring this information may not always refer to these appendices.</p> 
        <p>Further appendices provide elaboration on other widgets, as well as concepts that will be useful in disarming certain modules. </p>
