                    <p>
                        Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a local multiplayer party game for two or more players. The objective of the game is to defuse a bomb before time runs out by using the instructions found in the Bomb Defusal Manual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One player takes the role of the bomb Defuser. All other players take the role of Experts who must use the Bomb Defusal Manual to guide the Defuser through the challenging task of defusing a bomb.
                    </p>
                    <h1 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>What's This Document?</i></h1>
                    <p>
                        This document lists, on the next page, a bunch of links to custom merged HTML versions of those bomb defusal manuals I made, as well as information about these manuals on the pages thereafter for anyone who may be interested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These manuals are an attempt at merging modded manuals for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes into the base game's manual that isn't the game's automatically generated PDF. Large PDFs can get slow, and most of the mods' provided PDFs are outdated in some way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted a manual with everything in one place that I could simply link to people and it would have everything they'd need, and nothing more. The <a href="http://ktane.timwi.de">Timwi repo</a> is great, but it can give a bit of a sensory overload if you're new.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, since then this has turned into a more personal pet project where I just want a manual to use for myself that I am happy with.
                    </p>

                <p><i>Turn The Keys refers to other modules that may not have been introduced yet. These references have been omitted from its manual and reincluded when their respective module is added. A き symbol denotes when such change is applied to the Turn The Keys manual page compared to the previous section. This also applies to Souvenir & Modules Against Humanity, with the difference that every section introduces new Souvenir/MAH references, so no marking is applied to indicate these changes.</i></p>

                <h2>Changes</h2>
                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Besides merging manuals together, a couple other goals are pursued:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Merge duplicate appendices</b> - Appendices often appear multiple times with repeated information across different mods. These appendices will be merged.</li>
                    <li><b>Remove unneeded appendices</b> - Inversely, some appendices shouldn't be appendices in the first place, because they provide vital information for one module and one module only. These pages are moved back to their respective module's main manual.</li>
                    <li><b>Add extra appendices</b> - Some extra appendices may be added. Either because information is missing, duplicate, or other reasons. Module specific lookup tables will be placed in the appendices if this information was not initially provided in the original manual.</li>
                    <li><b>Adding back the fourth wall</b> - References to KTANE as a game are removed/altered. These manuals are supposedly written by bomb defusers, who would never refer to an explosive device as a 'game'.</li>
                    <li><b>Increasing printability</b> - Some manuals may be altered slightly to increase printer friendliness or in favor of creating a more cohesive and consistent manual overall.</li>
                    <li><b>Remove excess information</b> - In partial manuals, references to other pages or modules not present in that manual may be removed or altered.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>An effort is made to keep all manuals as close to their creator's original as possible, unless any of the above points apply or a different exception takes place. Any custom changes made to a manual will be listed here.</p>
                <p>Special thanks for Timwi and crew for providing these manuals in the first place.</p>

                <!-- <h3>Alternative Page Numbering</h3>
                <p>With the alternative page numbering pages are numbered in a more future proof way, allowing for easy adding of new modules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introductory pages are still numbered as normal, but without the 'of 23', eg. "Page 2".</li>
                    <li>Solvable module pages have their numbering prefixed with "1.", starting at "Page 1.1" for the title page.</li>
                    <li>Needy module pages have their numbering prefixed with "2.", starting at "Page 2.1" for the title page.</li>
                </ul> -->
                
                
            </div>
        </div>

                <!-- <ul>
                    <li>Any additional sections are numbered in the same way.</li>
                    <li>Appendices have roman numeral page numbering, eg. "Page III".</li>
                </ul> -->
                <!-- <h3>Ordering</h3>
                <p>By default, besides distinction between solvable, needy & appendix, page ordering will be determined by the module's release date, and not alphabetical, as the vanilla manual doesn't have its modules listed alphabetically either. This also ensures ease of updating.</p> -->

                <h3>Introduction Pages</h3>
                <p>Several changes are made to the 3 introduction pages of the manual.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a subtitle to the title page indicating a version.</li>
                    <li>Bombs could have more than 11 modules.</li>
                    <li>Bombs could gain more than 2 strikes before exploding.</li>
                    <li>Not every module can be solved in any order.</li>
                    <li>There exist more appendices than A, B, and C. Some manuals may not refer to A, B, C but still use them.</li>
                    <li>An index may be included for larger manuals.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>General Module Page Changes</h3>
                <p>The following changes have been applied to almost every module's manual pages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure ink blot splatter patterns to not be repetitive in context of the entire manual, and added them where they were missing.</li>
                    <li>Lots and lots of behind the scenes changes, such as html tags not being closed, and making stuff work within the context of the entire manual.</li>
                    <li>Page numbering added or changed to fit with the entire manual.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Translated Modules</h3>
                <p>Translated modules will have their own section due to many of them being page-hungry: Section 3.</p>
                <p>Instead of providing the translated manual pages, their manual pages will be rewritten for an English speaking target audience. As a result, and also to save printer ink, manuals for modules translated into multiple languages can be severely condensed.</p>
                <p>The manuals will still refer to their base counterpart's original manual for instructions, so that translated module manuals provide new information only. This new information also includes information to help tell the modules apart.</p>
                <p>Languages that use non-Latin script may have tiny changes made to them in favor of compatibility and readability for an English speaker. The Cyrillic font was changed entirely for something more readable because the original one was frankly horrible. The new one doesn't look pretty, but at least it's consistent and easy to read.</p>

                <p>Appendices may be removed, merged, or added for various reasons.</p>
                <p>The following lists all appendices in order of release date of the first module/widget that uses it, with an elaboration on changes or reasons for removal/addition.

                <h3>Module Specific Changes</h3>
                <p>Starting on the next page is a list of all modules in release order that are included in a manual, with any changes made to their manual pages listed besides them. Please report any differences with their original manuals that are not listed below or on the previous pages.</p>
                <p>Certain modules have had their margins, font-size, or similar altered significantly because they didn't fit on a page (without abusing the page number). Manuals with these changes have simply been marked with a ⇖ symbol.</p>
                <p>Some pages have minor language errors fixed. These are marked with a 🛠 symbol. It could be possible that in the meantime these have also been fixed in the original.</p>

                    <li><b>Cryptography</b>: Removed appendices and made them part of the solvable modules section, since these pages are actually required for disarming this module, and this module only. They don't provide useless backstory or optional tips. The top right also said 'Cryptography' indicating that placing these in the appendices was a rushed decision by the creator to begin with. Removing the appendix header also made the excerpt text fit on the page.</li>
                    <li><b>Turn The Keys</b>: ⇖ References to modules not present in sub-manuals may be removed. Bugged modules are still shown, but parenthesize the cube part of Orientation Cube to make the manual apply too when this module is paired with an actual Orientation module.</li>

                    <li><b>Skewed Slots</b>: Deappendified appendix. Left a copy of appendix placed in appendices which may be expanded upon by other modules.</li>
                    <li><b>Microcontroller</b>: Why is there just a random "Highlightable" in there? It isn't even. Removed it.</li>

                    <li><b>Murder</b>: The table 'below' but it's on the next page. Fixing.</li>
                    <li><b>The Gamepad</b>: ⇖ Deappendified appendix, rewrote its introduction. Also merged a copy of it with Skewed Slots' maths appendix and changed the reference.</li>

                    <li><b>Friendship</b>: ⇖ Decreased the squish of 'conscientiousness' as it now fits more due to the shrunk text size to fit the page.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Blind Alley</b>: Appendix to the appendices. Appendices do not get a flavor text, and remove the reference to 'the first page'.</li>
                    <li><b>English Test</b>: The appendix refers to this module, red flag that that appendix is exclusive to this one module only. Deappendifying it. Also it mentions 'lack of space', but the extra space needed is only two pages. So the original appendix remains with those two pages added. Removed the non-belonging flavor text. Rewrote some lines to stop mentioning the table's appendix-being. Also what the hell is the needy english test? Table is big now, sorting alphabetically.</li>

                    <li><b>Third Base</b></li>
                    <li><b>Who's On First Translated</b>: Merged step 1 tables to be 3 languages on 1 page (more didn't fit on the page, but would also ramp up the difficulty too much). Shrunk most step 2 tables down to fit two on one page. The look is vastly different from the original, but the gameplay experience should be close enough to the original for it to be okay. Condensed 42 pages to 22 (Step 1: 21 to 8, step 2: 21 to 14)</li>
                    <li><b>Souvenir</b>: Added some blank pages to futureproof the manual. Remove questions for modules not mentioned in the printed manual.</li>
                    <li><b>Word Search</b></li>
                    <li><b>Broken Buttons</b></li>

                    <li><b>Cheap Checkout</b>: ⇖ The defuser has a computer? Where? I only see a bomb and an alarm clock. Changed the text accordingly. Leaving the poor table sorting intact as I dont know what the author's intent was.</li>
                    <li><b>The Button Translated</b>: Put a big table with translations for all four labels. Condensed 21 pages to 1.</li>
                    <li><b>Morse Code Translated</b>: Put all the solutions into one table. Use Appendix M for the morse code decoding. Condensed 21 pages to 7 (3 solution table pages, 4 morse code interpretation pages).</li>

                    <li><b>Neutralization</b>: That appendix looks like it's only going to be ever relevant to neutralization, and is a hard requirement for it. Deappendifying it and moving it to main section 1 content.</li>
