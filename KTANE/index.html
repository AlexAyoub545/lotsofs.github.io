Some attempt at merging modded manuals into the vanilla manuals that isn't the game's automatically generated PDF (as I've heard complaints that large PDFs are slow, and most of the mod's provided PDFs are outdated in some way). 
This will also aim to fix appendices, which are all over the place. Appendices often appear multiple times with repeat information across different mods. 
Inversely, some appendices shouldn't be appendices in the first place. Some secondary goals are removing fourth wall breaking things, making manuals more printer friendly, and removing excess information refering to non-included mods.
Special thanks to Timwi & crew for providing these manuals in the first place. See the changelogs below:

Vanilla:
* No changes besides some behind the scenes stuff

Vanilla_AlternativeNumbering:
* Pages are numbered in a more future proof way:
-- The introductionory pages are still numbered as before, but without the 'of 23' (eg. "Page 2")
-- Solvable module pages have their numbering prefixed with "1.", starting countdown at "Page 1.1" for the title page.
-- Needy module pages have their numbering prefixed with "2.", starting countdown at "Page 2.1" for the title page.
-- Appendices will have roman numeral page numbering, eg. "Page III".

Modded Manuals:
* By default, besides distinction between solvable, needy & appendix, page ordering will be determined by module release date, similar to how the vanilla manual is not sorted alphabetically either.  
* Changed the introduction pages to account for mods
-- Bombs can have more than 11 modules
-- Bombs can have more than 2 strikes before blowing
-- Not every module can be solved in any order
-- There are more appendices than just A, B and C. Some manuals may not refer to A, B, C but still use it.
* Almost every module:
-- changed the ink blot splatter patterns to not be repetitive in context of the entire manual, and added them where they were missing
-- some BTS changes, such as html tags not being closed, and making stuff work in context of the entire manual
-- page numbering added, changed, to fit with the entire manual.

Road To Centurion - section 01:
* Colour Flash
* Turn The Key
* Turn The Keys: Decreased font sizes because the manual didn't actually fit on one page. Removed mentions of modules not actually in this pack.
* 3D Maze
* Skewed Slots: Appendix placed in appendices, and added a mention about negative numbers not being prime.
* Follow The Leader
* Blind Alley 
* Hexamaze
* Battleship: Changed some margins as the manual didn't fit on a page

Road To Centurion - section 02:
* Anagrams
* Word Scramble
* Square Button: Got rid of the red line and gave it the ink blots instead
* Simon States: Last table didn't fit on the page. Lowered table margins.
* Round Keypad
* Listening
* Morsematics: Reference tables moved to appendices, and made to appear like an appendix. Referenced the appendix on the module's main page, had to decrease margins to make it fit. Rid the red line.
* Forget Me Not: Margins to make the page fit, rid the red line.
* Plumbing: Rid the red line
* Safety Safe: Font size of big table to 98% because it just barely didn't fit
* Silly Slots
* Souvenir: Moved the big table to the appendices for ease of updating, and removed modules not present in this pack.
